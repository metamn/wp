# Design

* 'See more products' clicks are under 1% 
=> pagination/infinite scrolling is obsolete
* Responsive design is done via Sass
* Responsive images are done via noscript



# To care about:

* HTML5 outliner 
* YSlow (now Grade A, 98 score)
  * The only B is "Add Expires Header" but it is managed by W3 Total cache
  * Gzip is not done due to Apache/php.ini configuration is not always possible 
  on every servers  
* Google Page Speed is 85/100, the last 4 are not ok


# Plugins

* W3 Total Cache: cache, minify, expires header
* WP-DBManager: table optimisation, backups
* eShop
  * hard to activate (show two panels in wp-admin, create new admin user, empty browser cache)
